# Proposal 
Nour Ayyash

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Prison Break or Jailbreak (something related to block breaking)


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The basic block breaker game but I wanted to add customizable characters, power ups, and other effects. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My plan includes using pygame to create a 2D block breaker game. Although it is a very basic project, I was hoping to expand it further. Currently I am 
researching how to code a program that gives players options on what their character looks like. Replacing the basic rectangle block with a character is the first idea. 
I'd also like to add sound effects, power-ups, and ball variations.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

None

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Just Me

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish at least a basic version of the popular block breaker game even if I cant manage to 
customize it. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- foundation of the game
- whether or not I can make it take input to customize a character 
- if I can't, I'll choose a set character

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Best out come I Hope to accomplish is the previously stated features. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Since the block breaker game is relatively popular, my steps include watching tutorials on how to lay out the foundation of the game. I need to research pygame more
and see what I can and can't do within it. I also have to research how to take input from a player within a game rather than having a set design. The biggest challenge
for me has to be the amount of coding this is probably going to require as well as the new features I'll be playing around with.
